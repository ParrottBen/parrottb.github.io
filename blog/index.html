                        In Need of New Friends?
                    </h3>
                    <!-- DONE! After the closing heading tag, add three (3) paragraphs of text. -->
                    <p>
                        There are people who are a joy to be around, and people who are a joy to be away from. If the interactions with the people in your life feel forced lacking joy, goodness, ease, and flow, and if you being away from them makes you feel way better than being in their company, that is a clear sign you are in need of new friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If If your current friends and the people in your life make you feel like you owe them something – your time, money, energy, knowledge, etc., acting as though they are entitled to everything you are and have, that is a clear sign you are hanging out with the wrong crowd and that you might be in need of new friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the people in your life are constantly pointing out the terrible things happening in the world – because they are ‘realistic’ and they want you to know everything about everything, and if drama, tragedy, and negativity are always on the menu, then you might be in need of new friends. If your conversations are filled with empty and meaningless words that leave you feeling like much was talked about but nothing was actually said, this is yet another sign that you might be in need of new friends. If the people in your life make you feel like you’re all alone, even though you aren’t, that is a clear sign you might be in need of new friends. Always remember, Quality is better than Quanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a friend hooks up with your boyfriend or posts mean stuff about you on Facebook, it's obvious that it's time to let them go. However, bad friends aren't always obvious, which makes it important to watch out for the more subtle signs that you need new friends. It can be hard to let go of people that have been a part of your life, but bad friends can end up hurting our emotional wellbeing, and good social support is important for both our physical and mental health. It might take some strength, but saying goodbye to the toxic friends in your life can do you some good. Good friends just make you feel comfortable completely being yourself.
